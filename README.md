# Interior-point-method
In this project, I want to establish an ipm solver based on Mehrotraâ€™s predictor-corrector method. 
Ideally, the solver can solve both linear and convex programming. But right now, I just provide the linear 
programming solver. If I have time, I will finish the project.

The solver can only solve the linear programming with equality constraints.
If you want to use it when the problem with inequality constraints,
you need to make some modifications to your inequality constraints.
